with Thread.sleep), it will likely consume too much memory and throw an out-of-memory error.*/

//  It creates a coroutine scope and does not complete until all launched children complete.

/*** runBlocking and coroutineScope builders may look similar because they both wait for their body and all
 * its children to complete. The main difference is that the runBlocking method blocks the current thread
 * for waiting, while coroutineScope just suspends, releasing the underlying thread for other usages.*/

Coroutines follow a principle of structured concurrency which means that new coroutines can be only launched in
a specific CoroutineScope which delimits the lifetime of the coroutine.*/

/** Extract function refactoring */
//Let's extract the block of code inside launch { ... } into a separate function.
//When you perform "Extract function" refactoring on this code, you get a new function with the suspend modifier.
